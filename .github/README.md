## 🚀 Getting Started

I have outlined my workflow and usage in the [agents section](/agents/README.md).

This repository acts not just as documentation, but as an interactive environment where you can run scripts, agents, and tools to replicate my approach to solving the challenges. Read the [tools section](/tools/README.md) for details on interacting with the environment.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/christopherwoodall/2025-machine-in-the-middle.git
cd 2025-machine-in-the-middle

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -e .
```

> **NOTE:** Ensure you have activated the virtual environment before running any scripts or agents. This way they have access to all required dependencies.
